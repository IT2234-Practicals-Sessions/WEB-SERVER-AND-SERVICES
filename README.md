## Web Services Basics
Web services are software systems designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Key characteristics:
- Platform-independent
- Use standardized XML messaging
- Not tied to any OS or programming language
- Self-describing via standard XML format
- Discoverable via simple find mechanisms

## Server Technologies
Modern web services rely on various server technologies:
- **Web Servers**: Apache, Nginx, IIS
- **Application Servers**: Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions

## API Types
1. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**
   - XML-based protocol
   - Strict standards
   - WS-Security for enterprise applications

2. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**
   - Architectural style (not protocol)
   - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - JSON typically used for data exchange
   - Stateless operations

3. **GraphQL**
   - Query language for APIs
   - Clients request exactly what they need
   - Single endpoint for all operations

## Communication Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS (most common)
- WebSockets (for real-time communication)
- gRPC (high-performance RPC framework)
- MQTT (for IoT applications)
